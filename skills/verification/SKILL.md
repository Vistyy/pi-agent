# Verification

Requirements define the accepted result.
Implementation creates that result.
Verification establishes justified confidence that the result exists, and review judges whether the result and its evidence are sufficient.
A test is one possible source of evidence, not the default output.

## Philosophy

Start from the specific work rather than a preferred verification mechanism.
Consider what could materially be wrong and what observation would distinguish the accepted result from that failure.
Choose evidence after understanding the implementation, the boundaries on which its behavior depends, retained evidence, and mandatory gates.

Prefer evidence that observes the relevant behavior directly, would reveal the meaningful failure, and has proportionate creation and maintenance cost.
A broader, slower, or more durable mechanism is not inherently stronger.
Evidence establishes only what it actually observes.
For example, evidence produced with a test double does not establish integration with the real dependency.

When work changes an integration, run a normal operation through the changed boundary using the implemented revision.
Do not replace that boundary with a test double.
Tests of components, interruption, cleanup, or failure behavior do not prove that the normal operation works.
If no supported operation can establish this, report the integration behavior that remains unverified.
Treat missing, malformed, unavailable, or ambiguous observations as unknown rather than success.

Use this reasoning to guide judgment.
Do not require a verification plan, inventory, or standard output structure unless the user requests one or software must parse it.

## Understand the result

Read the accepted requirements and only the instructions, decisions, project strategy, and repository mechanisms relevant to the work.
Use requirements to determine what must be true.
Use applicable verification policy to determine mandatory gates and accepted constraints.
Do not strengthen the product guarantee merely to make verification easier or more comprehensive.

Identify the observations needed for justified confidence without turning every requirement, branch, or scenario into a separate verification record.
If no supported observation can establish a required result, expose the unresolved requirement, design, or capability instead of inventing confidence.

## Select and produce evidence

An agent may use any supported evidence that establishes the relevant behavior reliably.
Use a broader system boundary only when the behavior being established depends on that boundary.
When several mechanisms are credible, prefer the reliable one with lower execution, diagnosis, coupling, and maintenance cost.
Do not preserve or add a mechanism merely because it already exists, is familiar, or appears stronger by being broader.

Produce evidence for the exact work and relevant environment.
Record only the command or procedure, relevant environment, and observation needed to interpret the result.
Complete mandatory gates through their owning workflow instead of duplicating them manually.
If an evidence mechanism fails, report the failed mechanism and remaining uncertainty.
Do not interpret inability to collect evidence as either success or a product failure.

## Review verification

Before implementation, review whether the accepted outcome is observable and whether any prescribed verification constraint is feasible and capable of observing that outcome.
The absence of a prescribed mechanism is not itself a problem.

After implementation, review the exact work against the accepted result and available evidence.
Ask whether the evidence could distinguish a materially incorrect result from the accepted result, observes the boundaries on which that judgment depends, and corresponds to the relevant revision and environment.
Do not reject sufficient evidence merely because another mechanism is more familiar or broader.
Report only material confidence gaps and state what remains unsupported.
Distinguish insufficient evidence from a tooling or capability failure that prevents a trustworthy review.

## Durable regression coverage

Do not require a test by default.
Add durable automation when it can repeatedly reveal a plausible meaningful regression that other retained or proportionate one-time evidence would miss, and when that protection justifies its authoring and maintenance cost.
A requirement, branch, scenario, fixture, assertion, or changed line does not create that need by itself.
Prefer updating, reusing, consolidating, or removing retained coverage when that gives sufficient confidence at lower cost.

For a reproduced defect, demonstrating that a regression test fails against the defective behavior can strengthen the evidence when the supported environment makes that practical.
Do not require historical execution, mutation, or sensitivity experiments by convention.
Do not create durable evidence whose only purpose is to prove exact documentation wording or the absence of a retired concept unless that fact is itself an executable supported contract.

## Project-level activities

Read [Design a Verification Portfolio](references/DESIGN-PORTFOLIO.md) only when the user explicitly asks to design, reduce, or substantially reorganize maintained verification across a project.
Read [Manage Project Verification Strategy](references/PROJECT-STRATEGY.md) only when considering a durable verification decision that applies across work.
Routine verification does not require either reference.
